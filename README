This is cloudradio, a sound streamer for soundcloud, written in
CommonLisp

Progress:

15.2.2012:

Worked on OAuth2 authentication. Since cl-oauth only
supports oauth1 and has way too much dependencies, I've used the
solution for Google by "mtravers":
https://github.com/mtravers/waybacker/blob/master/src/oauth2-google.lisp
and modified it for my needs to support soundcloud.

I will continue working on this to get a library which supports:

* SoundCloud authorization
* Basic profile queries
* Fully fledged track-queries (tracks.json)

~5h

16.2.2012:

OAuth isn't really needed for our purposes, at least not for now, as
track-queries don't require authorization. Continue without OAuth for
now. Starting to build a library around tracks.json.

18.2.2012:

Library in progress (cl-soundcloud.lisp), investigated solutions to
decode and play mp3 files, found "mixalot":
http://vintage-digital.com/hefner/software/mixalot/mixalot.html which
solves this problem in a very nice way. Extensions are needed to play
mp3 from a stream instead of a file.

Priority #1 is the framework for profile generation and rating,
with fetching of new data coming close after that.

~3h

19.2.2012:

Starting on the profile generation and rating

~2h

23.2.2012:

Getting back to work, as i was sick in the meantime.

* Get a random track from soundcloud
